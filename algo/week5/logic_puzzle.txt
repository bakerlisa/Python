The Zebra Puzzle:

The puzzle consists of five different-colored houses in a row, each lived in by a resident of a different nationality.
 Each resident owns a different pet, prefers a different drink, and smokes a different brand of cigarettes than the others.

Youâ€™re given 15 other facts:

There are five houses.
The Englishman lives in the red house.
The Spaniard owns the dog.
Coffee is drunk in the green house.
The Ukrainian drinks tea.
The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house (to your right as you stand facing the row of five houses).
The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
Milk is drunk in the middle house.
The Norwegian lives in the first house.
The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.
The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.

1) Which man likes to drink water

------- What I did -------:
HOUSE:
1. filted out the one to ones
2. organized the data on how many clues they had

-The Norwegian lives in the first house.
    -Kools are smoked in the yellow house. (last color left so it belongs to Norigean)
        -Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept (blue house has the horse)
    -The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.

-The Englishman lives in the red house.
-The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house (to your right as you stand facing the row of five houses).

DRINK:
Coffee is drunk in the green house.
Milk is drunk in the middle house. (either ivory or red)



Thoughts:
he man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox. (can't be first or last)

Senerio:
*he man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
    *The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
        *The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
            *The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
1. Blue not chesterfield

Snerio:
yellow(Norigean){Kools} = 
blue{Lucky Strike}[orange juice.]<horse> -
ivory{Chesterfields}[milk] = 
green(Japanese){Parliaments}[coffee]<fox> - 
red(English){Old Gold}<snails>
1. red is in the middle 
    -we need to elimate that last few (2) which will tell us zebra and water and right now it'll all be guesses

yellow(Norigean){Kools} = 
blue<horse> -
ivory{Old Gold}[milk]<snails> = 
green[coffee]{Chesterfields} - 
red(English)<fox>
1. last two items

yellow(Norigean){Kools}<fox> = 
blue{Chesterfields}<horse> -
ivory{Old Gold}[milk]<snails> = 
green(Japanese){Parliaments}[coffee] - 
red(English){Lucky Strike}[orange juice]

yellow(Norigean){Kools} = 
blue<horse> -
ivory[milk]<fox> = 
green{Chesterfields}[coffee] - 
red(English){Lucky Strike}[orange juice]

yellow(Norigean){Kools} = 
blue{Lucky Strike}[orange juice]<horse> -
ivory{Old Gold}[milk]<snails> = 
green(Japanese){Parliaments}[coffee]<fox> - 
red(English){Chesterfields}

OR 

yellow(Norigean){Kools}<fox> = 
blue{Chesterfields}<horse> -
ivory(Japanese){Parliaments}[milk] =

red(English){Lucky Strike}[orange juice]

green[coffee]<fox> - 
red(English){Lucky Strike}[orange juice]

------ GUESSING -----
1. red placement could be midle or end

1) Which man likes to drink water
2) Which man owns a zebra



======= DO KNOW ======= :
yellow(Norigean){Kools} = 
blue<horse> -
ivory[milk] = 
green[coffee] - 
red(English)

OR 

yellow(Norigean){Kools} = 
blue<horse> -
red(English)[milk]
ivory = 
green[coffee]

Chester firld can't go to the right
